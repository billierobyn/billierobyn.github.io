    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Miami, with a Bachelors degree in Public Relations, and minors in Graphic Design and Advertising.</p>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic, hard-working individual with great inter-personal skills as a result of my exposure to different people from a range of backgrounds â€“ I grew up in England and moved to South Florida when I was 14, where I attended High School in Boca Raton with my family. Furthermore, I have studied in Boston, Massachusetts, where I completed my first semester of college at Boston University.</p>
    <p>I have always been greatly passionate about a vide variety of music, fashion and art, and would love to persue a career in one of these creative fields.</p>
    <p>I am well organized, I have strong writing skills, I have a strong work ethic and I have had a great deal of experiences, with my previous jobs and internships and travelling.</p>
    <p>Oh and I LOVE baking! Especially the decorating part!</p>
